April 3, 2025 - India’s exports in the most vulnerable sectors amount to only 1.1 per cent of India’s GDP, and India's trade surplus with the US is not significantly large, experts point out, so Trump’s tariff is unlikely to have a major negative impact on the overall Indian economy . 2 weeks ago - New U.S. taxes on American imports, even at 25 percent, will hurt many Indian businesses and may put vast numbers of people out of work. 6 days ago - Following the announcement, Indian stock markets dropped , and the rupee weakened as foreign investors sold off assets, although local buyers helped mitigate the decline.
